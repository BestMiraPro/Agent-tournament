# Operator Guide

How to run an Agent Tournament — the 100-agent parallel LLM competition with rounds, cloning/mutation, and an LLM judge.

## Quick start (mock mode, no LLM tokens)

```powershell
npm install
npm run tournament -- --goal "Write a single clear sentence defining what a tournament is." --rounds 2 --population 4 --mode mock
```

Mock mode uses a deterministic fake provider — it scores on keyword overlap, no real LLM calls. Use it to verify the wiring before spending tokens.

## Real mode (local — agents as host processes)

```powershell
npm run tournament -- `
  --goal "Produce the best possible answer." `
  --rounds 5 --population 20 --seed 42 `
  --db arena.db `
  --mode real --sandbox local `
  --workspace "C:\Users\you\arena-runs" `
  --judge-model "wandb/zai-org/GLM-5.2" `
  --reflect-model "wandb/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V4-Flash" `
  --worker-models "wandb/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V4-Flash"
```

Requires opencode `auth.json` at `~/.local/share/opencode/auth.json`. The CLI starts an opencode server, spawns agents as host processes against it, and runs rounds sequentially.

## Real mode (docker — agents in containers)

```powershell
npm run tournament -- `
  --goal "Produce the best possible answer." `
  --rounds 3 --population 10 `
  --mode real --sandbox docker `
  --workspace "C:\Users\you\arena-runs" `
  --auth-file "$env:USERPROFILE\.local\share\opencode\auth.json" `
  --judge-model "wandb/zai-org/GLM-5.2" `
  --worker-models "wandb/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V4-Flash"
```

Docker mode runs each agent in a resource-capped container, bind-mounting the auth file read-only. Requires Docker installed + the `agent-arena:latest` image built.

## CLI flags

| Flag | Default | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| `--goal` | "Produce the best possible answer." | The task every agent attempts |
| `--rounds` | 5 | Number of rounds |
| `--population` | 20 | Agents per round |
| `--seed` | 42 | RNG seed (deterministic runs) |
| `--db` | `:memory:` | SQLite path (use a file to persist across runs) |
| `--mode` | mock | `mock` (no LLM) or `real` (LLM via opencode) |
| `--sandbox` | local | `local` (host processes) or `docker` (containers) — real mode only |
| `--workspace` | (none) | Absolute path; agents' working dirs live under it |
| `--auth-file` | (none) | opencode `auth.json` — docker mode only |
| `--judge-model` | (none) | Model id for the judge |
| `--reflect-model` | (none) | Model id for the reflector (mutation) |
| `--worker-models` | (none) | Comma-separated model ids for the agents |

## Dashboard (live operator view)

The dashboard is a two-process local web app:

```powershell
# Terminal 1 — API + WebSocket on :4300
$env:OPENCODE_SERVER_USERNAME=""; $env:OPENCODE_SERVER_PASSWORD=""
npm run dashboard -- --db arena.db --workspace-root runs --auth-file "$env:USERPROFILE\.local\share\opencode\auth.json"

# Terminal 2 — Vite UI on :4301
npm run web:dev
```

Open `http://localhost:4301` (use `localhost`, not `127.0.0.1` — Vite binds IPv6).

### The dashboard workflow

1. **Browse runs** — the landing page lists all runs with summary stats (rounds, best score, cost). Click a row to open it.
2. **Create a run** — "Create run" takes you to the setup form: name, goal, sandbox mode, roster (model + count + temperature per row), judge/reflect model pickers, selection knobs, concurrency, pricing, budget.
3. **Run a round** — in the run view, the between-rounds controls let you start the next round, override criteria, add/retire agents, abort, or reconfigure (PATCH) the config for the next round.
4. **Review** — the agent grid shows live status; click an agent for its drawer (lineage, genomes, submission, diffs). The analytics panel has the fitness chart, model share, lineage tree. The round-detail panel shows the ranked entries with judge rationales.
5. **Export** — the Export dropdown (JSON or CSV) downloads the full run dump.
6. **Compare** — in the run browser, select two runs (checkboxes) and hit "Compare selected" to see a side-by-side config + score diff.
7. **Rejudge** — in round detail, pick a different judge model and "Rejudge" to see how a different judge would rank the same submissions (non-destructive — original scores are preserved).

### What you see live

The WebSocket pushes per-agent status/activity/usage and round status/scored/complete events. The grid updates in real time. If the connection drops, the dashboard reconnects with exponential backoff (a "Reconnecting…" banner shows the state).

## Troubleshooting

**`no opencode auth.json`** — the docker e2e + real mode need `~/.local/share/opencode/auth.json`. Set `ARENA_DOCKER_AUTH_FILE` to override.

**401 from the opencode server** — the desktop app leaks `OPENCODE_SERVER_USERNAME/PASSWORD` into the shell; the dashboard launcher scrubs them (`$env:OPENCODE_SERVER_USERNAME=""`). If you start the server another way, scrub them yourself.

**Port 4300/4301 in use** — kill the stale node process: `Get-NetTCPConnection -State Listen | Where-Object { $_.LocalPort -in 4300,4301 }` then `Stop-Process -Id <pid> -Force`.

**`workspaceRoot must be absolute`** — docker bind-mounts and local workspace mkdir both need an absolute path. Relative paths 400.

**A round failed without scores** — abort pre-judge leaves a round row with no scores. The round-detail panel shows "Scoring in progress" for in-flight or "entries appear after judging" for a failed round. The run continues; start the next round.

**Model not found** — the `/api/models` endpoint spawns an opencode server to discover models. If it 502s, the opencode server failed to start; check `auth.json` and that no stale server holds the port.
